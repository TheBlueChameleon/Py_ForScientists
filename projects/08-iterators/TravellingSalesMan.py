# The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a famous standard problem im computer science.
# The (basic) problem statement is the following:
#   Given a list of points (cities) to visit, what is the shortest path through all of them?
# The only known algorithm guaranteed to always find the shortest route is a brute force analysis of all possible
# routes, which has atrocious time complexity of O(N!).
# (There are N possible choices for the start city, from which one can visit (N-1) cities as second stop, from which
# one can visit (N-2) cities as third stop, etc.).
# A number of algorithms have been proposed that do not necessarily produce the best, but a "reasonably good" solution,
# i.e. one that is in the top 10% of all possible paths, while having a way better runtime.
# The code below shows both, a brute force implementation of the TSP as well as an approximation based on the following
# idea:
#   The next step in the path is always the city closest to the current one.
# This works extraordinarily well for small numbers of cities (where the brute force approach would be viable, too), but
# may be forced to make suboptimal choices toward the end of the path.
# Runtime is O(NÂ²): For each current city, we have to compute the lengths to O(N) other cities in order to find the
# shortest next path segment. So the approximation brings the problem from "impossible for long lists of points" to
# "viable for virtually any problem size".
# Usually, the paths found that way are pretty decent, too. The biggest flaw is that the starting point is often not
# optimal (which, in real world problems, might not be a degree of freedom to freely chose anyway).
# Note: an improved form of this algorithm exists (not implemented here), where the path generated in the way described
# above is checked for crossing lines. If any are detected, their targets are exchanged. This path is always shorter,
# which is a consequence of the triangle inequality.
# Here, we are not so much interested in the solutions as in the implementation using itertools.
